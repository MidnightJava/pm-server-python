Query examples to be run on the mongo shell

NB: quotes are needed around field names in a query when referencing embedded documents with
a dot separator, so I wrapped all field names in quotes for consistency.

$ mongo
> use PeriMeleon
> let col =db.households

# Find all married heads of household and their spouse
> col.find({"_Household__spouse": {$exists:true}}, {"_Household__head": 1, "_Household__spouse": 1}).pretty()

# Find all single heads of household
> col.find({"_Household__spouse": {$exists:false}}, {"_Household__head": 1}).pretty()

# Find all heads of household and their spouse if they are married
> col.find({}, {"_Household__head": 1, "_Household__spouse": 1}).pretty()

# Find all members of a household specified by family name
> col.find({"_Household__head._Member__family_name": "Jones"}, {"_Household__head": 1, "_Household__spouse": 1, "_Household__others": 1}).pretty()

# Find all members
> col.find({}, {"_Household__head": 1, "_Household__spouse": 1, "_Household__others": 1}).pretty()
